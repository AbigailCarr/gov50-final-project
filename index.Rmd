## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to American Indian/Native American health disparities study conducted by the Urban Indian Health Institute (UIHI), which reported that these numbers vastly underrepresented the Native American Covid-19 crisis, because a limited number of US states calculated Native American Covid-19 cases and deaths. The UIHI study refers to the CDC erasure of AI/AN Covid cases as “data genocide,” and claims it is a form of systemic oppression. Additionally, some states recorded Native American cases as “white” or “other” rather than indigenous people --- coding for missing variables and also comparing CDC data to UIHI data would serve as a way to explore Native American/American Indian Covid disaparities.
